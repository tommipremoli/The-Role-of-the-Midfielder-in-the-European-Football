# The Role of the Midfielder in the European Football
This repository analyzes the most decisive midfielders in Europe's top 5 football leagues (La Liga, Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1) during the 2021-2022 season, identifying those who had the greatest impact on their teams. Key metrics such as goals, assists, passing accuracy, and defensive actions are examined. Offensively, players like Kevin De Bruyne, Jamal Musiala, and Martin Ødegaard were the most prolific. Defensively, standouts include Nicolas Höfler, Youssouf Fofana, and Aurélien Tchouaméni. Midfielders excelling in passing, like Joshua Kimmich and Pedri, are also highlighted. Some players, such as De Bruyne and Tchouaméni, are recognized for their influence across multiple areas. The research also mentions Alexis Mac Allister, who had the highest percentage of expected goals and moved from Brighton to Liverpool in the summer. The analysis offers a comprehensive view of the top-performing midfielders in Europe and reveals notable trends, such as the lower performance of Serie A midfielders in comparison to other leagues.
