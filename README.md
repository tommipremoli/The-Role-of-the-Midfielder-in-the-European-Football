# The Role of the Midfielder in the European Football
The role of the midfielder in the sport of football is universally recognised as the most complete, requiring extraordinary versatility that includes defensive and offensive skills. This research aims to identify and analyse midfielders who have proven to be particularly decisive in their teams, in the highly competitive contexts of the top 5 European leagues: La Liga, Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1.

Using an approach based on data analysis and visualisation, the research will explore several key variables, including goals scored, assists, passing accuracy, defensive actions, and other relevant metrics to assess the overall impact of midfielders. The dataset will consist of the players' 90-minute statistics for the 2021-2022 season.

At the end of the research, we will have a clear understanding of which midfielders have been most decisive in their teams and how these contributions influence the overall performance of teams in Europe's top 5 leagues.
